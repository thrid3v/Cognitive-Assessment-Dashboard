## 📊 9-Point Neurological Biomarker Panel

NeuroSentinel analyzes speech using **9 distinct biomarkers** across acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic dimensions:

### 1. **Pause Rate** 
- **Type**: Linguistic Timing
- **Description**: Ratio of pause time to total speech duration
- **Calculation**: `pause_time / total_duration` (pauses > 0.25s)
- **Clinical Significance**: Elevated pause rates (>0.4) indicate hesitations and word-finding difficulties, common in early cognitive decline
- **Healthy Range**: < 0.40

### 2. **Vocabulary Richness (Type-Token Ratio)**
- **Type**: Linguistic Complexity
- **Description**: Ratio of unique words to total words spoken
- **Calculation**: `len(unique_words) / len(total_words)`
- **Clinical Significance**: Reduced lexical diversity suggests semantic memory impairment
- **Healthy Range**: > 0.50

### 3. **Word Count**
- **Type**: Linguistic Fluency
- **Description**: Total number of words spoken in the recording
- **Calculation**: Direct count from speech-to-text transcription
- **Clinical Significance**: Lower word counts may indicate reduced verbal fluency
- **Healthy Range**: > 20 words (for typical assessment)

### 4. **Speech Rate**
- **Type**: Temporal Dynamics
- **Description**: Words spoken per second
- **Calculation**: `word_count / total_duration`
- **Clinical Significance**: Slowed speech rate (<2.0 wps) correlates with processing speed deficits
- **Healthy Range**: > 2.0 words per second

### 5. **Initial Latency**
- **Type**: Response Time
- **Description**: Time delay before first word is spoken
- **Calculation**: Timestamp of first word from recording start
- **Clinical Significance**: Delayed response (>0.5s) indicates cognitive processing delays
- **Healthy Range**: < 0.5 seconds

### 6. **Acoustic Texture (MFCC Mean)**
- **Type**: Acoustic Feature
- **Description**: Mean of first Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient
- **Calculation**: `np.mean(librosa.feature.mfcc(y, sr, n_mfcc=13)[0])`
- **Clinical Significance**: Reflects voice quality and articulatory precision; changes may indicate motor speech disorders
- **Healthy Range**: Baseline comparison (typically > -350)

### 7. **MFCC Delta**
- **Type**: Acoustic Dynamics
- **Description**: Rate of change in MFCCs (spectral dynamics)
- **Calculation**: `np.mean(librosa.feature.delta(mfcc))`
- **Clinical Significance**: High variability suggests unstable articulation; low variability indicates monotonous speech
- **Healthy Range**: Stable values (|delta| < 0.05)

### 8. **Speech Brightness (Spectral Centroid)**
- **Type**: Acoustic Feature
- **Description**: Center of mass of the frequency spectrum
- **Calculation**: `np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y, sr))`
- **Clinical Significance**: Lower values indicate muffled or less energetic speech, associated with reduced vocal effort
- **Healthy Range**: > 1500 Hz

### 9. **Emotional Range (Pitch Variance)**
- **Type**: Prosodic Feature
- **Description**: Variance in fundamental frequency (F0)
- **Calculation**: `np.var(pitch_values)` from `librosa.piptrack()`
- **Clinical Significance**: Reduced pitch variance indicates flat affect and emotional blunting
- **Healthy Range**: > 1,000,000 (high expressiveness)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### Primary Classification Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Implementation**: `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`
- **Training Data**: 2,000 synthetic samples (500 per class)
- **Feature Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation

#### Optimized Hyperparameters
```python
{
    'n_estimators': [200, 500],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],
    'class_weight': ['balanced', None]
}
```

### Speech Recognition Model
- **Model**: Vosk (Kaldi-based ASR)
- **Version**: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 (English), vosk-model-small-hi-0.22 (Hindi)
- **Purpose**: Speech-to-text transcription for linguistic feature extraction
- **Language**: English (US) primary; Hindi supported via cross-lingual transfer (see below)
- **Size**: ~40MB (EN) + ~45MB (HI)

### Hindi Language Support (Experimental)

Hindi is supported by reusing the English-trained Random Forest classifier rather than training a separate Hindi model, since no labeled Hindi cognitive-decline speech dataset exists publicly or was otherwise accessible for this project. This works because:

- The 4 pure-acoustic biomarkers (MFCC mean, MFCC delta, spectral centroid, pitch variance) are computed directly from the waveform and are language-independent.
- The 5 ASR-derived biomarkers (pause rate, vocabulary richness, word count, speech rate, initial latency) depend on Hindi transcription (via `vosk-model-small-hi-0.22`) and can shift for reasons unrelated to cognitive status (e.g. Hindi's word segmentation differs from English's).

To correct for that, `src/calibrate_hindi.py` computes the mean of those 5 features across a handful of healthy Hindi recordings (`data/healthy_hindi/*.wav`) and offsets them to match the English healthy baseline before scoring. **Limitation**: since no Hindi recordings with diagnosed/observed cognitive decline were available to validate against, this calibration is checked only against healthy speakers — it has *not* been validated on Hindi speech reflecting actual cognitive decline. Treat Hindi results as experimental; the UI displays this caveat whenever Hindi mode is used.

**Setup**: download and extract [`vosk-model-small-hi-0.22`](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) into `models/vosk-model-small-hi-0.22/`. Calibration is optional — without it, Hindi mode still works using raw cross-lingual transfer; run `python calibrate_hindi.py` (from `src/`) after adding a few recordings to `data/healthy_hindi/` to enable it.

The calibration currently shipped (`models/hindi_calibration.json`) was generated from 15 clips of the OpenSLR SLR103 Hindi ASR corpus (general adult speech, not age/health-screened controls) — see `data/healthy_hindi/SOURCE.md` for provenance and its limitations. On that sample, 14/15 clips classified as "Healthy" both with and without calibration, so on this dataset it mainly served as a validation check rather than a large correction. Swap in real Hindi speaker recordings and re-run the script if you get access to any.

### Feature Extraction Libraries
- **Librosa**: Acoustic and prosodic feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral centroid, pitch tracking)
- **Vosk**: Real-time speech recognition with word-level timestamps
- **NumPy**: Statistical computations

## 🎯 Classification Categories

The system classifies cognitive health into **4 categories**:

| Label | Code | Description | Clinical Indicators |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Healthy** | 0 | Normal cognitive function | Low pause rate, high vocab richness, normal speech rate |
| **Mild Decline** | 1 | Early cognitive impairment | Slight hesitations, reduced lexical diversity |
| **Moderate Decline** | 2 | Moderate cognitive impairment | Noticeable pauses, slowed speech, reduced word count |
| **Severe Decline** | 3 | Advanced cognitive impairment | Significant delays, very low fluency, flat prosody |
